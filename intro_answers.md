1. You could visualise the data in a histogram to identify the unemployment distribution per state better, 
with potential outliers or common levels of unemployment rate.  The data itself is already ordered which makes
it easy to identify the min and max values (and possibly also the median as it isn't such a large dataset).
We could also provide data for the mean, median and mode.
And we could use saturation colours on the table itself to add a visual dimension to show higher and lower rates of 
unemployment per state.

2. In the dataset given, we could plot it on a geographical map using a grey scale to show variations in the data per state.
A similar example would be the geographical representation of population density with bar charts:

Also the above map makes good use of layering.
Another good example of tabular data shown visually I think is this running data: http://flowingdata.com/2014/02/05/where-people-run/
This shows where people run and overlays the traces on top of one another resulting in showing most popular routes, 
which seem to follow water streams and be away from main roads.
I think both a histogram and a line graph are generally good options for showing tabular data, remembering that a histogram 
should start at zero because it compares height (whereas a line graph compares slopes and therefore doesn't necessarily 
need to start at zero).
